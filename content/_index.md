Tired of inferior wireless internet? Fed up with slow speeds, dropped connections, throttling, and bad customer service? The future is around the corner, literally.

Community Fibre is laying new fibre internet in the area, and we have an opportunity to choose where they expand next. If we get enough people to sign up, Community Fibre can start laying fibre early 2018.

If you live in Franktown, Gillies Corners, Prospect, 6th Line, 7th Line, Ferguson Road, or surrounding areas, now is your chance to show that there is demand for faster internet at a reasonable price.

Please fill out the form below. It's not a contract, and will only be used as a heat map for where it's possible to expand.
